# AppliedNumericalMethodPackage

> An Applied Numerical Method Package For Everyone.

## Purpose

Mathematic can accelerate Programming in some cases. Numerical Methods are the basic function to realize and it really works in different way. In my work and academic periods, some of them were used again and again. Many friends often talk to me about How to insert these Algorithms in their Projects.Therefore, I decided to code a software package for reused.

## Language Used in the Project

MatLab, C/C++, Julia and FORTRAN.
